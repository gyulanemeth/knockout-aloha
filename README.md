knockout-aloha
==============

A knockout.js binding to the fancy aloha editor!

Due to this binding, it's easy to use the Aloha editor with knockout.js.

The amd version of this binding is under development. It's quite complicated to find out, hogy should the Aloha Editor work with require js. (The hints on the official site are invalid in some cases...)
